in the begining we explain some information about our project
this project is for all data in hospitals systems that we have and people who needs check up , follow up ,surgery or doctor visits
so people addmit to the hospital and use Facilities of there and it will be save as a case file that we have and it inclouds all the prices and the doctor names and so on.
here we needed datas of the all services groups that can be provided for example all visits of a specified date.
and then we create some links for people that have the permission to see all these datas in Oracle Apex.
by the way because of the huge data that we had we needed to create tables of our main data and then we could use the filters
additionally all datas must be in the specified date so we added that for the creation table.
and in the end we could see all the links that we created of the task that we talked about.
